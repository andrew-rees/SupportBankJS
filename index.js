//need to access the .CSV file 
    //("Either parse the file yourself, or search NPM for a relevant CSV parsing library!")
//need to order it in a way that the JS can understand -  
    //"Use a class for each type of object you want to create." 
    //- what objects do I need? Date, from, to, narrative, amount, so 4 objects - Date, user, narrative and amount?
    // Do I need to define a variable 'transaction' with different objects - Date, user, narrative and amount?
    // Are From and To users to different objects, or just 1 object used differently? 1 OBJECT USED DIFFERENTLY

//create an account for each person (create an accountName 
//find a way to link a transaction to an account, coming from another account - IF TRANSACTION IS THE VAR, THIS WOULD WORK
//need to take input from readline.prompt() of two types:
    //- List All, should output the names of each person, and the total amount they owe, or are owed.
    //- List [Account], should also print a list of every transaction, with the date and narrative, for that account with that name.
//Functions required:
    //Finds all names, sees what they are owed (in to), and owe (in from)
    //Finds all transations that involve a user in from or to


///INPUT
    // 1) Read file, parse and print DONE
    // 2) Create suitable data structure to store transations, and populate them
    // 3) List All console output, and work out what to print out 
    // 4) Create data structure for accounts
    // 5) List Account console output, and work out what to print out

//allows readline prompt to be used
const readline = require('readline-sync');

//allow use of transaction.js
const Transaction = require('./Transaction.js');

//allow use of account.js
const Account = require('./account.js');

//to allow moment for time
const moment = require("moment");

//use it
let aTime = moment ();

// let sixthJuly2018 = moment ("06.06.2018");
// console.log(sixthJuly2018);

// 1 - require moment, and call moment
// 2 - tell moment that the dates in the csv are in a certain format
// 3 - convert the csv dates into a format moment can understand, as dd-mm-yyyy doesn't seem to be in ISO or RFC

// 1) Format All list to be like individual list (look at how individual sections are returned)

// 3) After Another Search - how to loop this back to name input - do while loop
// 4) After "Sorry, no matches" - how to loop this back to name input - do while loop
// 5) Set up moment for dates
